# Python DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) GFG Self Paced Course

## Overview

- This repository contains solutions to problems from the Python Data Structures and Algorithms course by GeeksforGeeks (GFG).
- The solutions are written in Python and organized by DSA topics.
- I enrolled in this course as part of the 3-90 challenge to improve my problem-solving skills using Python.


## Structure
The repository is divided into different sections based on DSA topics, such as:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Sorting and Searching algorithms, and more.

Each section contains:
- A well-documented Python solution for each problem.
- Explanation of the approach where necessary.
- Time and space complexity analysis to understand the efficiency of the solution.

## Handwritten Notes
- I have prepared detailed handwritten notes for every topic covered in the course.
- These notes include:
  - A summary of the key concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms.
  - Visual representations and diagrams for better understanding.
  - Important points to remember for interviews and exams.
- The notes serve as an excellent resource for:
  - Quick revision before interviews.
  - Reinforcing concepts while learning DSA with Python.
  - Providing deeper insights into complex topics with visual aids.

## Usage
1. **Explore the Code**: Navigate through the directories to find solutions for different DSA topics. 
2. **Learn and Implement**: Before referring to the solution, try solving the problem on your own. Once done, you can check my implementation for comparison and better understanding.
3. **Review Notes**: Use the handwritten notes to grasp the underlying concepts more thoroughly.


## Contribution
Feel free to fork the repository and contribute if you wish to add new solutions, improve existing ones, or provide better explanations. Together, we can make this a richer resource for everyone!

## Note
These solutions are meant for **learning and reference** purposes only. Please make sure to try solving problems independently before referring to the solutions here to maximize your learning.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
