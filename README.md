# Python DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) GFG Self Paced Course Solutions

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the problems from the **Python Data Structures and Algorithms** course offered by **GeeksforGeeks (GFG)**. The solutions are written in Python and are carefully organized by topic, making it easier to navigate and find specific DSA concepts.

I purchased this course as part of the **3-90 challenge** on GFG, which aims to help learners strengthen their DSA skills in Python within 90 days. This repository serves as both a learning resource and a reference for others who want to understand the concepts of DSA more deeply.

## Structure
The repository is divided into different sections based on DSA topics, such as:
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees)
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion
- Sorting and Searching algorithms, and more.

Each section contains:
- A well-documented Python solution for each problem.
- Explanation of the approach where necessary.
- Time and space complexity analysis to understand the efficiency of the solution.

## Handwritten Notes
To complement the code, I have also prepared **handwritten notes** covering each topic in detail. These notes summarize the theory behind the data structures and algorithms, including visual representations and key points that help reinforce understanding. They can be a great resource for revision, especially before interviews or exams.

## Usage
1. **Explore the Code**: Navigate through the directories to find solutions for different DSA topics. 
2. **Learn and Implement**: Before referring to the solution, try solving the problem on your own. Once done, you can check my implementation for comparison and better understanding.
3. **Review Notes**: Use the handwritten notes to grasp the underlying concepts more thoroughly.

## Why This Repository?
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: It covers a wide range of DSA topics, providing a well-rounded understanding of key concepts in Python.
- **Clear and Concise**: Each solution and note is designed to be easy to understand, with comments and explanations to guide you through complex topics.
- **Practical**: The solutions and notes are practical, focused on helping you prepare for coding interviews, competitive programming, and academic exams.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork the repository and contribute if you wish to add new solutions, improve existing ones, or provide better explanations. Together, we can make this a richer resource for everyone!

## Note
These solutions are meant for **learning and reference** purposes only. Please make sure to try solving problems independently before referring to the solutions here to maximize your learning.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
